Minishell notes

Formed by
-main:
	.start with readline
	-signals:
		-ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
		-ctrl-D exits the shell.
		-ctrl-\ does nothing.
-parser:
 	-lexer-> prende l'input e lo pulisce da spazi e tab /n
	-tokenizer-> spezza input in token con split
	-expander -> $ checks in env 
-executor:
	-built-in:
		-echo with option -n
		-cd with only a relative or absolute path
		-pwd with no options
		-export with no options
		-unset with no options
		-env with no options or arguments
		-exit with no options
	-execve: launch commands for example cat and ls
	-pipe:
		-cat takes input from pipe and echo
	-redirection 
		-can be both ways
		-if right argument misses (echo pippo > or echo <) throws error
		-first priority over built-ins
		-use > to create new file from stdout example (ls > file1)
		-use >> to append to a file from stdout example (ls >> file1)
		
Tests:
	> file1 echo > file2 pippo -> should create file1 and file2 with pippo inside
	echo pippo > file1 | cat -> doesnt print anything because the output of echo goes into file1
